# Treasure Island Adventure Game
This Python project is a fun, interactive text-based adventure game where the player embarks on a quest to find hidden treasure. The player makes choices that guide the journey, with each decision leading to different outcomesâ€”some bringing the player closer to the treasure, and others leading to surprising (and sometimes perilous) fates!

The game is designed to help beginners understand conditional logic and decision trees in Python while providing a narrative experience.
